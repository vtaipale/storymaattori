# storymaattori / Nucheron IV

Game about managing a platoon of soldiers in a grim scifi-war.

You, their commander, must manage these "elite" warriors although
you will never see the battles yourself, only the effect it has 
on your soldiers.


Main feature is the evolving storyline that is generated around your soldiers.

Totally not ready. Art never is!

Installation: 
Build using Unity3D and launch.
